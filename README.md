# ColourSwitchRemake
Remake of the game Color Switch with different obstacles.

Disclaimer: I did not create the original game nor do I own the rights to Color Switch. This project is a fun remake I decided to create to improve my programming skills and will not be used for commercial purposes.

This project uses the Processing 4.0 core library, as indicated in the settings.json file. This library can be downloaded on the Processing website.
